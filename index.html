    <h2> Projects </h2>
    <hr />
    <h3> Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 Classifier </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Engineered a feed-forward fully-connected network and a convolutional neural network from scratch in Numpy for size
            70,000+ MNIST dataset and size 60,000+ CIFAR-10 dataset respectively; achieving 86% and 81% test accuracy post-training</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> SPAM Mail Classifier </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Devised classifier with decision tree and random forest with Python, accomplishing top 10 accuracy among 600+ people</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Digit Classification </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Self-implemented deep neural networks with three hidden layers for classifying handwritten digits using Python</li>
        <li>Combined gradient descent and cross-validation techniques to identify the optimal learning rate, resulting in a 20% increase in
            Gitlet
            model convergence and enhanced performance in predicting by 10%, ultimately achieving 89% test accuracy</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Gitlet </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Architected and deployed a Java-based Git Version Control System, enabling seamless code collaboration and performing</li>
        <li>Incorporated Serializable interface to serialize data in .gitlet file format, enabling effective storage and retrieval of previous file versions and commit trees; streamlined version control process, resulting in 25% reduction in release cycle duration and runtime</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Toppa @ Berkeley </h3>
    <h4> External Project Leader </h4>
    <ul> 
        <li>Spearheaded team of five undergraduates in the design and training of machine learning model utilizing Jupiter Notebook and
            Google Colab; collected and cleansed 20+ datasets using Pandas, enabling 80%+ accurate prediction of wildfires in CA </li>
        <li>Leveraged advanced statistical techniques such as linear and logistical regression to quantify relationships between different
            variables and the magnitude of wildfires, informing targeted prevention efforts and reducing fire-related damages by 15%
            </li>
    </ul>
